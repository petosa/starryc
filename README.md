# starryc
A MIPS compiler for Starry, an esoteric programming language.

# What is Starry?
Esolang has a great page discussing the origins of Starry. https://esolangs.org/wiki/Starry
- Designed by Yukata Hara in his 2008 book Rubyで作る奇妙なプログラミング言語, in which he presents a simple Ruby interpreter for Starry, as well as other languages like BF, Whitespace, and Chef.
- Stack-based programming language, using almost exclusively `push` and `pop` operations.
- Languages consists entirely of `+*.,`'` as well as spaces.
- A fun/novelty language, sometimes used for code golfing.

This tool is an exercise in compiler writing, but can be used as advertised if you ever do need to compile Starry source.
